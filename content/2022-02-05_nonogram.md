A lovely, simple grid-based puzzle game.

The objective is simple: make the correct grid cells filled in and optionally
cross out the empty cells. The numbers at the top and on the left show how many
filled cells are in each group down the given column/row. Each group of cells
will be that many separated by at least one empty cell.

The numbers are also guaranteed to be in order. This means if you see `1 3` next
to the first row, there will be one filled cell before three filled cells in the
row. For a board size of 5, 1 FILLED + 1 EMPTY + 3 FILLED = 5 Filled, so we can
fill the first cell and last three, leaving the second blank.
